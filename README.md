# ARPymol - Augmented reality from Pymol

To prepare your model:
  - Load and customize your model in Pymol
  - avoid using mesh representation, and minimize sticks, balls and lines, as they will increase the file size. The size limit is 25 MB.
  - transparency will not be applied in the model
  - To generate your 3D object, use the command:' save filename.gltf ', or go to File - Export image - GLTF...
  - Experiment!
